  <h1 class="projecttitle">PayDay 2</h1>
  <div class="project-page">
    <div class="pro-description">
        <p class="p2">Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter game where the player takes control of one of the 
            gang's twenty-two members and can perform heists alone, or with up to three teammates. The player can participate 
            in a variety of heists, including but not limited to robberies of banks, shops and armored cars, and producing 
            and distributing narcotics.</p>
            <p class="p2">I'll be doing a review of the game's UI from a UX perspective, using my own professional opinion 
                as well as some of my gaming friends' personal player opinions.<br> Please note that this is my personal, 
                professional opinion in this review, and other designers might have different ideas.

          <p class="p2">Overall the game is very exciting. I have only played the game as a single player so far so I can't say 
            anything about the cooperative gameplay, but I found the game very hard. It could just be that I'm not used to playing 
            strategic games like this, but even with the easiest settings it was very hard to actually succeed in the game for me.
            Even if it was hard, it was very engaging and exciting to play and I easily got caught up in the feeling of the game.<br>
            The things that made me reluctant to play the game again was not the difficulty or the gameplay, but the UI and UX in 
            a great part of the game. I have given separate reviews below on the UI that I had issues with as well as the design 
            suggestions on how I would like to have done it differently.

        <h2>Main Menu</h2>
        <img src="PayDay2\Menu.png" class="projectimg2">
        <div class="pro-description">
            <p class="p2">Here is a screenshot of the game's Main Menu. From my own observations I can tell directly that the 
                player is going to have a focus issue. The player avatar takes up all of the focus instead of being a fun feature, 
                and the menu selections are arranged to the right which makes them unimportant 
                in the eyes of the player, and makes it awkward for the player to read them, since we are generelly geared towards 
                reading things from the left.</p>

            <p class="p2">
                I asked a few gaming friends to give me their opinions on the menu, both people that haven't played the game before 
                as well as people who has played it, or the earlier released one. I summarized their collective opinions here, and they are largely 
                similar to some of my own observations:
            </p>
         <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">Players were disoriented and uncomfortable with the menu being arranged to the right, as well as the position to the right side of the screen.</li>
    <li class="p2">The players find the text in the menu somewhat hard to make out, because of contrast issues, and they need to focus extra to be able to read it.</li>
    <li class="p2">The DLC link is invading the play experience</li>
</ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Design suggestions - Main Menu</h2>
        <div class="pro-description">
          <p class="p2">
            Here is my personal design of the Main Menu. I have rearranged the assets to create a new focus path for the player, to make sure that the actual menu is the 
            first thing that the player sees.<br>
            As can be seen, all of the text now have a solid background and/or proper contrast so that the player don't need to focus their eyes as much, and even those 
            that might have some kind of color blindness can read everything. For the hover state, the text can still be found over the menu, but now the link 
            for DLC does not create a barrier between them. The DLC link has been broken away from the menu but is still in a medium focus. The background 
            has been cleaned up a little bit, because while it was estetic and painted a good picture of the game, it was too busy and could cause 
            distraction among players with cognetive disabilities. Less is more in this context in my opinion.<br>
            Unlike other aspects of life, size does matter in the world of design. Prioritizing the different options with size is a great way to make sure 
            that the user navigates correctly.
