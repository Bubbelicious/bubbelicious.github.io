  <div class="project-page">
    <div class="pro-description">
        <p class="p2">Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter game where the player takes control of one of the 
            gang's twenty-two members and can perform heists alone, or with up to three teammates. The player can participate 
            in a variety of heists, including but not limited to robberies of banks, shops and armored cars, and producing 
            and distributing narcotics.</p>
            <p class="p2">I'll be doing a review of the game's UI from a UX perspective, using my own professional opinion 
                as well as some of my gaming friends' personal player opinions.<br> After doing the review I will give some 
                design suggestions on how I would have improved the UI if I could.

        <div class="pro-description">
            <p class="p2">Here is a screenshot of the game's Main Menu. From my own observations I can tell directly that the 
                player is going to have a focus issue. The player avatar takes up all of the focus instead of being a fun feature, 
                and the menu selections are arranged to the right which makes them unimportant 
                in the eyes of the player, and makes it awkward for the player to read them, since we are generelly geared towards 
                reading things from the left. <br>
                Another issue is the unfortunate naming in the menu's Play options makes it seem like the player have to open up another window or Browser 
                to be able to play.</p>

                I asked a few gaming friends to give me their opinions on the menu, both people that haven't played the game before 
                as well as people who has played it, or the earlier released one. I summarized their collective opinions here, and they are largely 
                similar to some of my own observations:
            </p>
         <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">Players were disoriented and uncomfortable with the menu being arranged to the right, as well as the position to the right side of the screen.</li>
    <li class="p2">The words that are used in the menu makes the newer players confused and unsure of what they represent.</li>
    <li class="p2">The players find the text in the menu somewhat hard to make out, because of contrast issues, and they need to focus extra to be able to read it.</li>
    <li class="p2">The DLC link is invading the play experience</li>
</ul>
