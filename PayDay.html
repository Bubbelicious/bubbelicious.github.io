  <h1 class="projecttitle">PayDay 2</h1>
  <div class="project-page">
    <div class="pro-description">
        <p class="p2">Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter game where the player takes control of one of the 
            gang's twenty-two members and can perform heists alone, or with up to three teammates. The player can participate 
            in a variety of heists, including but not limited to robberies of banks, shops and armored cars, and producing 
            and distributing narcotics.</p>
            <p class="p2">I'll be doing a review of the game's UI from a UX perspective, using my own professional opinion 
                as well as some of my gaming friends' personal player opinions, and I have made some design suggestions on 
                how I would have done the design instead.<br> Please note that this is my personal, 
                professional opinion in this review, and other designers might have different thoughts and ideas.

          <h2>Main Menu</h2>
            <p class="p2">Here is a screenshot of the game's Main Menu. From my own observations I can tell directly that the 
                player is going to have a focus issue. The player avatar takes up all of the focus instead of being a fun feature, 
                and the menu selections are arranged to the right which makes them unimportant 
                in the eyes of the player, and makes it awkward for the player to read them, since we are generelly geared towards 
                reading things from the left. I would also recommend to never have moving visuals in the background when you want people 
              to be able to read things. It is very distracting (video not available yet).

                I asked a few gaming friends to give me their opinions on the menu, both people that haven't played the game before 
                as well as people who has played it, or the earlier released one. I summarized their collective opinions here, and they are largely 
                similar to some of my own observations:
            </p>
         <ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">Players were disoriented and uncomfortable with the menu being arranged to the right, as well as the position to the right side of the screen.</li>
    <li class="p2">The players find the text in the menu somewhat hard to make out, because of contrast issues, and they need to focus extra to be able to read it.</li>
    <li class="p2">The DLC link is invading the play experience</li>

          <h2>Design suggestions - Main Menu</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            Here is my personal design of the Main Menu. I have rearranged the assets to create a new focus path for the player, to make sure that the actual menu is the 
            first thing that the player sees.<br>
            As can be seen, all of the text now have a solid background and/or proper contrast so that the player don't need to focus their eyes as much, and even those 
            that might have some kind of color blindness can read everything. For the hover state, the text can still be found over the menu, but now the link 
            for DLC does not create a barrier between them. The DLC link has been broken away from the menu but is still in a medium focus. I have also reduced the visuals in
            the background a bit, because while it was aestetic and painted a good picture of the game, it was too busy and could cause 
            distraction among players with cognetive disabilities. Less is more in this context in my opinion.<br>

    <h2>Career</h2>
        <p class="p2">
          The Career page is where you can see your progress in the story line.<br>
          Again I have to complain about the distracting, moving background (video not available yet), and because of the lack of proper text background the text sometimes 
          disappear in the background bacause of the light color of the moving visuals here.<br>
          The dark background pared together with the faded blue of the Play options makes for a very inadequate contrast in my opinion. If the player 
          were on the spectrum of color blindness, the text would disappear entirely into the background.<br>
          What I really like about the career page is that there is a 'voice mail' that reads out the mission parameters so that the player can listen to 
          it instead of reading it. It helps a lot for players that have dyslexia for example.

          <h2>Design Suggestion - Career</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            What I would have done on the Career page would have simply been to increase the contrast on pretty much everything. A semi-solid background for the white text, and a brighter 
            color of blue for the clickable texts is plenty enough to make a drastic improvement. Contrast is very important, not only so that people with color blindness 
            also can enjoy the experience, but also to reduce the concentration that the 'regular' player have to use when they read the texts.

          <h2>HUD</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            The Head of Display UI is generelly pretty good. It's not in the way, easy to read, and the background of the text darkens if there are light colors in the background 
            visuals. However, I have two things that still bother me.<br>
            The indicator that means that an enemy is approaching on your position shows up as a soft blue semi-circle, tilted in the direction that the enemy is located. 
            It is a <i>very</i> soft blue color that is very easily lost in the visuals around you. Blue is also not a color that is associated with danger or warnings, so 
            it took me a while to understand what the semi-circle that popped up sometimes meant.<br>
            Also, the 'current situation' text field in the top right corner will tell the player what is happening in the game. Once the Police Assault starts, it shows up in 
            yellow, which works fine, but when the Point of No Return warning comes up it is in red and can barely be seen at all unless you are facing a dark background visual.

          <h2>Design Suggestion - HUD</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            For the Heaf of Display, I decided to give a better background to almost all of the texts to make sure that the player never loses sight of the text because of 
            background visuals and so that they can focus all of their attention on the game without having to focus on the text to be able to read it. A semi-solid, dark background 
            works much better for the red 'Point of no Return' warning text, and the red semi-circle for approaching enemies give a much better feeling of danger and/or warning 
            than the previous blue in my opinion.

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
          <p class="p2">
            Overall the game is very exciting. I have only played the game as a single player so far so I can't say 
            anything about the cooperative gameplay, but I found the game very hard. It could just be that I'm not used to playing 
            strategic games like this, but even with the easiest settings it was very hard to actually succeed in the game for me.
            Even if it was hard, it was very engaging and exciting to play and I easily got caught up in the feeling of the game.<br>
            The things that made me reluctant to play the game again was not the difficulty or the gameplay, but the UI and UX in 
            some very important parts of the game experience.
