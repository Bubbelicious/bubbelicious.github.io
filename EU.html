            <p class="p2">This school assignment consisted of doing user research, idea workshop, 
              redesigning the app, and then presenting the changes to "the client" (which in this case 
              was played by our teacher).<br>
              Research and workshop was done in groups, while the redesigning phase was done individually.<br>

    <h3>User research</h3>
      <p class="p2">The first thing we did once we got this assignment was to read the reviews from the 
        app store, on how users thought about using the app, and it was clear that the users were not happy 
        with it. After testing the app ourself, we quickly found several pain points in the 
        user flow that should be retified. We tested the same user flows on other people in our social 
        surrounding and found that they had almost exactly the same problem that we had with the app.<br>
        Using a customer journey map, we mapped the general flow and used the data we had recieved from 
        our user testings to fill it out, with very clear results.

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">The first thing we noticed was that people are very reluctant to give out their phone number 
        when they don't know anything about the app yet. Many commented that they would much rather log in 
        with their Google-account or email. A quick check also showed that there is no information on how you 
        have your account, as well as any information given, erased. The Privacy Policy states that you can have 
        your information deleted at any time, but does not say how to go about it. This is a direct violation 
        against GDPR rules on collecting personal information and need to be retified as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">Once logged in to the app, user get very confused on what to do next since there is nothing 
        that indicated what your next move should be. After testing out the map, and checking the menu (which 
        resulted in it's own frustrations) users would try out the scanning function on the closest bike, only to 
        find out that they needed to buy credits before scanning.<br>
        Long story short, the users became very frustrated with user flow, lack of choices both in logging in and 
        paying, lack of information, as well as the bad condition of the bikes that could be rented.

    <h3>Workshop</h3>
      <p class="p2">Our group decided to do a workshop for idea generating. The participants were another 
        group in our class, and we had some issues with the actual implementation of the workshop after 
        the outbreak of Covid-19 but eventually managaed to adjust it into a workshop online.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">The workshop exercises we decided on using were, firstly a simple warm-up of writing 
        down three positive and three negative things about the app on post-its. Next we did an exercise 
        called Wishful thinking, where the participants were asked to come up with as many ideas they could 
        that would improve the app. The crazier the better, but simple things could also be added. Lastly 
        we did an exercise that's called Pessimist vs Optimist, where everyone would chose one of their ideas 
        from the earlier exercise and defend it against the other participants, who would try to come up with 
        issues in the idea.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">While both we as workshop leaders and the participants had some issues getting used to 
        performing the exercises over a video chat, we all thought it went well and that it was a fun time.

    <h3>Design</h3>
      <p class="p2">When starting on my redesign, I made sure that the graphic profile of EU-bike 
        wasn't lost during the change. There was nothing wrong with the idea of the app's user flow, 
        but the functions that are included in the flow need to be a lot more user friendly.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">During a quick test on some people, I changed the design just slightly 
        to incorporate the proper color prioritation.
      </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="project-page">
  <div class="pro-description"> 
    <h2>Start</h2>
      <p class="p2">Users were frustrated that they couldn't use other means of signing in, so as I redesigned 
        the starting page, adding the logo and color of the product so that you would know what you were using, 
        I made sure to add other ways to sign in into the design.
      </p>
        <p class="p2">I made a tutorial, a very short one, so that the user would know what they were suppose to 
          do once they were logged in. Users can still skip it if they feel like they don't need it, but I felt it 
          was better to have one that users can skip, then not have one at all.

    <h2>Home</h2>
      <p class="p2">During user testings, I noticed that every user tried to 
        press on the bikes that were within reach of the map first, even before they pressed 
        the button to scan. So in my own design I changed it so that you have to click on 
        the bike to be able to scan it. To lessen the frustration of trying to scan without 
        the credits needed, I also added so that you can both see how many credits you have 
        and have a quick route to the wallet to buy more if you need to.
      </p>
        <p class="p2">If someone have reported an issue with the bike you want to scan, the 
          issue will be displayed as shown. This way you won't try to track down a bike that 
          turns out to be broken. The search function was added so that you can check for bikes 
          in specific areas.

    <h2>Menu and Profile</h2>
      <p class="p2">The app's menu is very poorly sorted and not user friendly, so in my 
        design I removed the profile function entirely since it only contained a way to sign 
        out. Putting the sign out button in the menu eliminated the need for a profile, and if 
        there is a need to change the information of the account, there is a setting function. 
      </p>
        <p class="p2">Adding a help function makes the users feel safer when using the product, 
          and there you will find both contact information to the support as well as the tutorial 
          if you feel the need to go over that again.

    <h2>Wallet</h2>
      <p class="p2">There were a lot of frustrations over the wallet among the users, because 
        you could only buy 20 credits at the time and only by sharing your card information. So as 
        I made my design I also added more choices in what you can get for your money as well as 
        ways to pay.

<div class="project-page"> 
  <div class="pro-description"> 
    <h2>Scan to ride</h2>
      <p class="p2">When you scanned the code to unlock the bike, there was no confirmation that 
        the process had started except that the lock on the bike was unlocked. Same when you wanted to 
        end the session and lock the bike. I decided to add 
        a page where you can see how long you have used the bike and how many credits that are being 
        used, as well as an easy way to find how you end the session and lock the bike again.
      </p>
        <p class="p2">After you lock the bike again, you get a small confirmation where you have a 
          quick route to History to look at the payment details.

    <h3>Summary of learning</h3>
    <p class="p2">I learned a lot of how to applicate the principles of design when both reviewing 
      an existing design, as well as when developling a design of your own.<br>
      I learned that it is better to have a product with a few basic functions that works great, than to 
      have a product with many cool functions that doesn't work all the way through.<br>
      I also learned while testing my own design how important color choices are when you want to prioritize 
      buttons in the viewers eye, and that small packages of product sell better then big ones, even if they 
      are more expensive in the long run.
