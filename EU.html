          <h1>EU- Bike</h1>
            <p class="p2">This school assignment consisted of doing user research, idea workshop, 
              redesigning the app, <br>and then presenting the changes to "the client" (which in this case 
              was played by our teacher).<br>
              Research and workshop was done in groups, while the redesigning phase was done individually.<br>

    <h3>User research</h3>
      <p class="p2">The first thing we did once we got this assignment was to read the reviews from the 
        app store, on how users thought about <br>using the app, and it was clear that the users were not happy 
        with it. After testing the app ourself, we quickly <br>found several pain points in the 
        user flow that should be retified. We tested the same user <br>flows on other people in our social 
        surrounding and found that they had almost exactly the same problem <br>that we had with the app. <br>
        Using a customer journey map, we mapped the general flow and used the data we had recieved from 
        our user testings to fill it out, <br>with very clear results.
