          <h1>EU- Bike</h1>
            <p class="p2">This school assignment consisted of doing user research, idea workshop, 
              redesigning the app, <br>and then presenting the changes to "the client" (which in this case 
              was played by our teacher).<br>
              Research and workshop was done in groups, while the redesigning phase was done individually.<br>

    <h3>User research</h3>
      <p class="p2">The first thing we did once we got this assignment was to read the reviews from the 
        app store, on how users thought <br>about using the app, and it was clear that the users were not happy 
        with it. After testing the app ourself, we quickly <br>found several pain points in the 
        user flow that should be retified. We tested the same user flows on other <br>people in our social 
        surrounding and found that they had almost exactly the same problem that we had <br>with the app. <br>
        Using a customer journey map, we mapped the general flow and used the data we had recieved from 
        our user testings <br>to fill it out, with very clear results.

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">The first thing we noticed was that people are very reluctant to give out their phone number <br>
        when they don't know anything about the app yet. Many commented that they would much rather <br>log in 
        with their Google-account or email. A quick check also showed that there is no information on <br>how you 
        have your account, as well as any information given, erased. The Privacy Policy states that <br>you can have 
        your information deleted at any time, but does not say how to go about it. This is a direct <br>violation 
        against GDPR rules on collecting personal information and need to be retified as soon as possible.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">Once logged in to the app, user get very confused on what to do next since there is nothing<br> 
        that indicated what your next move should be. After testing out the map, and checking the menu <br>(which 
        resulted in it's own frustrations) users would try out the scanning function on the closest <br>bike, only to 
        find out that they needed to buy credits before scanning.<br>
        Long story short, the users became very frustrated with user flow, lack of choices both in <br>logging in and 
        paying, lack of information, as well as the bad condition of the bikes that could be rented.

  <p>"Oh my god! This menu is driving me crazy, how do you get out of it!?"</p>
  <p>"I don't want to give them my card information, do people actually use this?"</p>

    <h3>Workshop</h3>
      <p class="p2">Our group decided to do a workshop for idea generating. The participants were another 
        group in our class, <br>and we had some issues with the actual implementation of the workshop after 
        the outbreak of Covid-19 <br>but eventually managaed to adjust it into a workshop online.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">The workshop exercises we decided on using were, firstly a simple warm-up of writing 
        down three positive <br>and three negative things about the app on post-its. Next we did an exercise 
        called Wishful thinking, <br>where the participants were asked to come up with as many ideas they could 
        that would improve the app. <br>The crazier the better, but simple things could also be added. Lastly 
        we did an exercise that's called Pessimist <br>vs Optimist, where everyone would chose one of their ideas 
        from the earlier exercise and defend it against the <br>other participants, who would try to come up with 
        issues in the idea.
      </p>
      <p class="p2">While both we as workshop leaders and the participants had some issues getting used to 
        performing the <br>exercises over a video chat, we all thought it went well and that it was a fun time.
