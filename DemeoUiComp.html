                <h2>UI Components</h2>
                <p class="p2">These components are made in the design software (in this case: Figma) 
                    so that the UI artist will have them available once they start creating the assets. 
                    In doing this you make sure that all of the assets of the same type are exactly the same size 
                    because the UI artist use the components as a base when they make them. It is also a way for the 
                    UX designer to make pixel perfect wireframes that may include the same assets or functions.<br>
                    It takes a little bit of time to create a component library, but it is worth it down the line.
