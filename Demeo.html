                    Demeo is a cooperative, dungeon crawl, RPG game from Resolution Games that was 
                    originally released in VR, but was always planned to be cross-plattform with at least 
                    PC as well.<br> 
                    Together, up to four players will move through different "dungeons", defeating and avoiding 
                monsters, collecting loot, and keep each other alive through a varied combination of skill-based cards.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p2">For this game I worked on the UX design for the PC version, did research and gathered the
                        accessibility settings that should be included in the PC version, as well as implemented 
                        some of the UI in Unity.<br>
                        I also made a little surprise project for the company that is linked last of the projects on this page.

                   <p class="p2">This project was about adapting the designs from the VR game into 
                       a version that could be used on a PC or console, without losing any functions 
                       or effects. As such there were some important requirements that had to be considered 
                       that could be summarized as written here.
                   </p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">All game functions from VR version is to be included</li>
    <li class="p2">Color and form must be cohesive with VR version</li>
    <li class="p2">Settings are to be adapted and updated for PC and/or console usage</li>
    <li class="p2">Menus are to be inviting and intuitive</li>
</ul>

You can choose one of the projects bellow for a closer look at what I worked on, but I want to point out that 
the project of this game has continued after I stopped working at the company, so some changes might be noticible 
between my work and the current look in the game.

                        <p class="p2">One of the function I worked on were making wireframes for the screen that 
                            is used for showing the player's individual progression as they level up in the game, as 
                            well as the rewards they would get for each level.<br>Another function is the information pane, 
                            that will be reused in places like the shop and player selection, where further information about 
                            an object or character will be needed or wanted.<br>We also made sure to calculate the character 
                            limits for every screen to make it easier for copywriting later.

                        <h2>Main Layout</h2>
                        <p class="p2">
                           Once I started working on this project, the team had already gotten some work done. 
                           The first iteration of the navigation bar didn't need my help, so the first I worked 
                           on was the main layout of the progression page, to find out what kind of size 
                           the main progression function would need and could get.<br>
                           In the second iteration you can see that the information hierachy of the navigation has 
                           been improved for the users' usual prioritation. The design has also been given the official 
                           Demeo font to test the character size properly against the design.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Player Progression</h2>
                        <p class="p2">
                            Next the progression bar was messured out, thickness based on the size of surrounding icons and 
                            length based on how much white space it would need on the side to balance out the design. Above the progression bar 
                            had to contain space for reward information depending on what level the user had reached. The image for reward representation 
                            needed to be readable for the user, as well as symetrical. The amount of images was reached based on 
                            the length of the progression bar (which is why the progression bar was introduced into the design first), as well as 
                            the distance between the images that balanced out the design best.<br>
                            You can see that in the second iteration, when the Demeo font and buttons were introduced, that the space for the rewards 
                            are slightly smaller. That is because the balance was somewhat thrown off once the official font was introduced and had to be 
                            compensated for.

                            This information pane was originally designed to show more information about the rewards that the user could get during progression, 
                            but it was also made so that it could be adapted to any object or character in the game that needed further information.<br>
                            The positive point of doing an adaption for an already existing game is that you don't have to personally make up a text that 
                            tests the wireframe design since it already exists. The design on this wireframe was generated by gathering all the information 
                            that needed to be displayed in an information pane, and find the right balance of space and text for the user to be able it skim it if they want.

                <p class="p2">One of the functions that I worked on were making wireframes for the screens that are used 
                    when the player choses a Play action. The actions in question are: Join Game or Create Game, and the 
                    designs had to include a screen for joining a specific room, loading screens, and error 
                    screens.<br>
                    We also made sure to calculate the character limits for every screen to make it easier for copywriting later.

                <p class="p2">
                    If a player want to join a specific game, with friends for example, they would need to enter the correct 
                    room number that the creator of the game session have to share with them. Below you can see my first and second 
                    iteration of the screen to choose which game room the player want to join.<br>
                    Since the actions and information that had to be included into the page such a small amount, and don't take up much 
                    room on the page, I decided that a centered design made more sense. The left over space around can easily be filled 
                    in with mood-setting illustrations or similar, and a centered design would be easier to balance for the UI artist.

                    loading interactions by changing out information text and background illustrations. These are the first and second iteration 
                    of the Loading screen when player has chosen the game room they want o join, as well as an example on how it can be adapted 
                    for a player that create their own game session.

                    You never want something in the game to fail, but they do. Sometimes it's because of creation error, sometimes a connection error, 
                    and sometimes it's because of player error. Either way, there need to be a page in the game that tells the player what has gone wrong, 
                    and give them options on how it can be fixed. Error messages are an important part in making the player feel secure, and should always 
                    be included in the design process. Below you can see iterations of error screens for when the chosen game room failed to load for some reason, 
                    as well as if the room could not be created for a new session. It can also be adapted into other parts of the game by changing the information and options available.

                    The button design was imported and multiplied before they were adapted for their specific purpose, to make sure that later iterations kept to the right sizes, and the menu's background was added from 
                    the original VR game's UI library that was already available.

                <p class="p2">The Inventory button in the In Game menu was coded to bring the player to their Inventory page. In this page, the grid of 
                    category images were imported in rows before they were adapted for their specific purpose, to make sure that later iterations kept to the right sizes. By this point in the project we had no illustrations 
                    that could be used since all earlier illustrations were for a VR perspective, so the categories had to make do with names only. When this page 
                    was later tested, they found that without illustrations they couldn't test it properly because the test-user didn't understand the different categories.

                    images were imported as a row and was then coded into a carusel of three images at the time, with the buttons on either side to move it, to make sure that later iterations kept to the right sizes. The progression bar 
                    was not imported for this step because the testing of the rewards were the focus at the time.

                    drop-downs, or click options for every setting opportunity. The list of which settings can be found in <a href="#Settings">Setting Selection</a> further down on this page.

                    gameplay was added. No actual help information was added in this iteration, since the testing that was planned was only targeting navigation and not 
                    information.

                <p class="p2">In the Character Selection page, the player could choose which character they wanted to play as. The player could take a look at the different 
                    characters in a 3D perspective, and if they had it they might choose to change the skin of the character before selecting it. The images of the characters 
                    were coded to light up the character that was currently being looked at, but since we didn't had 3D images of all the characters available, the front character 
                    didn't change. <br>
                    When this iteration of the Character Selection page was made, there were only four different characters that could be chosen from.</p>

                <h2>In Game Shop</h2>
                <p class="p2">In the In Game Shop, which can be found between levels in the gameplay, the player can buy new cards for their hand with the coin they might have 
                    collected during the game, as well as sell cards from their hand that they have no use for. The important part of this design was that the shady trader character (whose name changed between iterations) 
                    had to be visible in some manner so that it still had the same In Game feeling as the VR version. Buying or Selling cards depended on the chosen category over the 
                    grid of cards, and you can see which players that have finished their shopping in the row of characters underneath the card grid. The card shapes were imported to make 
                    sure that the illustrations of later iterations kept to the proper sizes.

                <p class="p2">Bellow you can see screenshots of the current look in the game. As you can see, there have been many iterations since my contribution to the project. My contribution 
                    was mainly used during the first tests of the navigation of the menus, and has since then been much improved upon as it should.
