                    Demeo is a cooperative, dungeon crawl, RPG game from Resolution Games that was 
                    originally released in VR, but was always planned to be cross-plattform with at least 
                    PC as well.<br> 
                    Together, up to four players will move through different "dungeons", defeating and avoiding 
                monsters, collecting loot, and keep each other alive through a varied combination of skill-based cards.</p>
                        
                        <p class="p2">For this game I worked on the UX design for the PC version, did research and gathered the
                        accessibility settings that should be included in the PC version, as well as implemented 
                        some of the UI in Unity.<br>
                        I also made a little surprise project for the company that is linked last of the projects on this page.

                <div>
                   <p class="p2">This project was about adapting the designs from the VR game into 
                       a version that could be used on a PC or console, without losing any functions 
                       or effects. As such there were some important requirements that had to be considered 
                       that could be summarized as written here.
                   </p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">All game functions from VR version is to be included</li>
    <li class="p2">Color and form must be cohesive with VR version</li>
    <li class="p2">Settings are to be adapted and updated for PC and/or console usage</li>
    <li class="p2">Menus are to be inviting and intuitive</li>
</ul>
<p class="p2">
You can choose one of the projects bellow for a closer look at what I worked on, but I want to point out that 
the project of this game has continued after I stopped working at the company, so some changes might be noticible 
between my work and the current look in the game.

                        <p class="p2">One of the function I worked on were making wireframes for the screen that 
                            is used for showing the player's individual progression as they level up in the game, as 
                            well as the rewards they would get for each level.<br>Another function is the information pane, 
                            that will be reused in places like the shop and player selection, where further information about 
                            an object or character will be needed or wanted.<br>We also made sure to calculate the character 
                            limits for every screen to make it easier for copywriting later.

                        <h2>Main Layout</h2>
                        <p class="p2">
                           Once I started working on this project, the team had already gotten some work done. 
                           The first iteration of the navigation bar didn't need my help, so the first I worked 
                           on was the main layout of the progression page, to find out what kind of size 
                           the main progression function would need and could get.<br>
                           In the second iteration you can see that the information hierachy of the navigation has 
                           been improved for the users' usual prioritation. The design has also been given the official 
                           Demeo font to test the character size properly against the design.
                        </p>    
                    
                    <img src="Demeo\Progress1.jpg" class="projectimg2">
                    <img src="Demeo\Progress2.jpg" class="projectimg2"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-page">
                    <div class="pro-description">
                        <h2>Player Progression</h2>
                        <p class="p2">
                            Next the progression bar was messured out, thickness based on the size of surrounding icons and 
                            length based on how much white space it would need on the side to balance out the design. Above the progression bar 
                            had to contain space for reward information depending on what level the user had reached. The image for reward representation 
                            needed to be readable for the user, as well as symetrical. The amount of images was reached based on 
                            the length of the progression bar (which is why the progression bar was introduced into the design first), as well as 
                            the distance between the images that balanced out the design best.<br>
                            You can see that in the second iteration, when the Demeo font and buttons were introduced, that the space for the rewards 
                            are slightly smaller. That is because the balance was somewhat thrown off once the official font was introduced and had to be 
                            compensated for.

                            This information pane was originally designed to show more information about the rewards that the user could get during progression, 
                            but it was also made so that it could be adapted to any object or character in the game that needed further information.<br>
                            The positive point of doing an adaption for an already existing game is that you don't have to personally make up a text that 
                            tests the wireframe design since it already exists. The design on this wireframe was generated by gathering all the information 
                            that needed to be displayed in an information pane, and find the right balance of space and text for the user to be able it skim it.

                            Character limits are calculated to make it easier for fonetic copywriting. Using the letter "W" makes sure that any kind of words will fit 
                            within the limit since it is one of the broadest letters no matter the font that is used in the end. This way, once the team starts with copywriting, 
                            they know how many character that will fit, as well as what font size they will need to use so that the users' can read it easily.<br>
                            Here is the calculated character limits for the Player Progression screen.
