                    Demeo is a cooperative, dungeon crawl, RPG game from Resolution Games that was 
                    originally released in VR, but was always planned to be cross-plattform with at least 
                    PC as well.<br> 
                    Together, up to four players will move through different "dungeons", defeating and avoiding 
                monsters, collecting loot, and keep each other alive through a varied combination of skill-based cards.</p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        For this game I worked on the UX design for the PC version, did research and gathered the
                        accessibility settings that should be included in the PC version, as well as implemented 
                        some of the UI in Unity.<br>
                        I also made a little surprise project for the company that is linked last on this page.

                <h2>Requirements</h2>
                <div>
                   <p class="p2">This project was about adapting the designs from the VR game into 
                       a version that could be used on a PC or console, without losing any functions 
                       or effects. As such there were some important requirements that had to be considered 
                       that could be summarized as written here.
                   </p>
<ul class="ul1">
    <li class="p2">All game functions from VR version is to be included</li>
    <li class="p2">Color and form must be cohesive with VR version</li>
    <li class="p2">Settings are to be adapted and updated for PC and/or console usage</li>
    <li class="p2">Menus are to be inviting and intuitive</li>
</ul>
