        <p class="p2">This website is a recrutement site for the big event organization NärCon.<br>
          I have personally been a volonteer at their events since 2012, and unfortunately the 
          website has not changed much since then, and is very outdated. Also, considdering the current 
          regulations about accessability and availability online, NärCon panda does not meet the 
          requirement that are recommended.<br>
          This is a problem since NärCon is very adamant about accepting everyone no matter of disability or
          other. I have therefore taken upon myself to redesigning the site to meet the WCAG requirement 
          as well as updating it and adapting it with a mobile design (something the current one lacks).<br>
          <i>Project still in progress.</i>

        <h3>Research</h3>
          <p class="p2">Since I have personal experience with the site, not much actual research was needed to collect
            the data I needed. I have heard many complaints about the site, and started noting them down when I 
            decided that it needed to be changed. I completed these notes with a few unstructural interviews to get 
            the whole picture.<br>
            I used the tool Lighthouse, as well as Siteimprove Accessability Checker, to get the exact data of what needs
            to be adjusted for the site to be up to WCAG requirement.

    <h2>Result of Research</h2>
      <p class="p2">From my research I learned that while the graphics are outdated, they hold
        up to the WCAG requirement for color and contrast but the site is severly underworked in terms of 
        accessability in the code. The site is not adapted for people with sight disabilities or
        other who need to tab their way through the site. This is not something I can personally
        do anything about, but I will bring it up none the less.</p>
        <p class="p2">On the other hand, the personal interviews gave an entirely other perspective.
        The users are often frustrated with the navigation on the site, and find it hard to locate 
        what they are looking for.<br>
        While the navigation seems to be the biggest concern for users, they all have other problems 
        that they mention. Some reaccuring ones are: Private Messages, Profile settings, Applications, 
        Search, and Discussions.

    <h3>First Design</h3>
      <p class="p2">One things I had to keep in mind when redesigning the site was that NärCon has a 
        very recognizable profile, and I had to make sure that my design incorporated. The website was to
        be given a desperatly needed update, but it still had to be recognized as one of NärCon's sites.<br>
        Tidying up the navigation was my main concern, as well as figuring out how the site would look as it
        adapted itself to a mobile user. These would be the first things I worked on before going deeper 
        into the functions on the site.

    <h2>Start page</h2>
      <p class="p2">For the start page, and log in function, I tidied up the navigation 
        to make it easier to find what you are looking for, and moved the functions of creating
        an account and forgotten password into the log in function since you don't want to have 
        to look for it if you need it.
      </p>
        <p class="p2">While I kept the idea of a background image, I made sure to darken it enough for it to
      not be distracting or annoying for the eyes.

      <p class="p2">I made sure that the design for the mobile adaption was as close to the desktop 
      site as possible, since it needs to still read as the same website.</p>
        <p class="p2">I decided to make the navigation into a hamburger menu to make it as easy to 
          navigate as possible without making it cluttered.

  <div class="pro-description"> 
    <h2>Home page</h2>
      <p class="p2">The navigation menu on the home page is very overwhelming and confusing.<br>
        In my design I decided to keep the menu from the start page since the functions 
        still are there but for some of them under different names in the current site.
        My design also includes an easier to locate profile, as well as all the functions 
        that are included in that, and grouping together the application function with the 
        teams that are available to make it easier to find.

  <div class="pro-description"> 
      <p class="p2">The mobile adaption to the home page follows a simliar pattern as the start 
      page, trying to make it as recognizable from the desktop site as possible. The menu 
    is meant to be easy to navigate and not be too cluttered while trying to fit the needed 
  functions in it.</p>

    <h2>Home Page functions</h2>
      <p class="p2">The sites functions on messages and notifications used to have their own page,
        which according to users was not at all user friendly, but in my design I decided to give 
        the users the option on viewing and gaining access to their messages directly from the home 
        page. My inspiration for this is fairly obvious (Facebook), but it is a lot more user friendly 
        and you can still go to the page specifically for messages and notifications if you want to 
        view all of them.
