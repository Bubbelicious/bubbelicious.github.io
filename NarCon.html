      <h1>NärCon Panda</h1>
        <p class="p2">This website is a recrutement site for the big event organization NärCon.<br>
          I have personally been a volonteer at their events since 2012, and unfortunately the <br>
          website has not changed much since then, and is very outdated. Also, considdering the <br>current 
          regulations about accessability and availability online, NärCon panda does not <br>meet the 
          requirement that are recommended.<br>
          This is a problem since NärCon is very adamant about accepting everyone no matter <br>of disability or
          other. I have therefore taken upon myself to redesigning the site to meet <br>the WCAG requirement 
          as well as updating it and adapting it with a mobile design <br>(something the current one lacks).

        <h3>Research</h3>
          <p class="p2">Since I have personal experience with the site, not much actual research was needed to collect
            the data I needed. <br>I have heard many complaints about the site, and started noting them down when I 
            decided that it needed to be changed. <br>I completed these notes with a few unstructural interviews to get 
            the whole picture.<br>
            I used the tool Lighthouse, as well as Siteimprove Accessability Checker, to get the exact data of what needs
            to be <br>adjusted for the site to be up to WCAG requirement.
