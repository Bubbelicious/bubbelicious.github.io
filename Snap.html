            The graduation project that I created for the end of my education 
            for UX design and Requirement engineering at Chas Academy.
            The area that I chose to focus on was the difficulities that people with
            executive disabilities, that are connected to diagnoses like Autism,
            ADHD, etc, face every day when trying to get thing done.

        <h3>Phase 1 - Data and Analysis</h3>
          <p class="p2">After some preliminary research into the subject of Neuropsychiatric 
            diagnoses, I narrowed down the functions of the brain that make up most of the
            executive abilities that people with these kind of issues have problem with.<br>
            Motivation, Concentration, Planning, Memory and Energy seemed to be the greatest
            villains of this story.<br>
            Using these functions I then gathered quantitative data by sending out a form on 
            social media to find out which of these functions that gave them the most struggle.
            I also gathered information about what kind of supportive products they have used 
            before and which of these were most helpful, as well as if they have a support 
            person in their life.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">To follow up on the statistics from the form, I also encouraged people 
          to sign up for a unstruktured intervju to help me get a better understanding of the 
          answers behind the numbers.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram I then analysed the data to be 
            able to create behaviour types that would help me keep my work on the right track.</p></div>

              <h2>Results</h2>
                <p class="p2">I had to do two different analytics since my first form was 
                  only reached by people over the age of 26. I used the same form, but had some 
                  help (by Lena Ogland) reaching a younger age group.<br>
                The results of the two analytics had no significant difference, so age would have no 
              impact on further work.</p>
                <p class="p2">I found that the majority of people with executive disabilities find 
                  that Motivation and Energy are what they have the most issues with in their life, 
                  and depending on their diagnosis and age they may also experience some smaller issues 
                  with either Concentration or Memory as well.
                </p>
                <p class="p2">According to the statistics they have also used a series of different products 
                  to try and help, but they find lists the most helpful so far even if it loses it's 
                  helpfulness as time passes. The statistics also said that not many had tried a rewarding 
                system before, but all the ones that had tried it found it the most helpful thing they had 
              ever tried.</p></div>

            <h3>Phase 2 - Concept and Design</h3>
              <p class="p2">To get a grip of the concept that I wanted to focus on for this project I 
                sketched out the different stakeholders as well as their preliminary needs. It's was 
                during this process that I realized that the app would need to have two different 
                accounts depending on if you needed help or if you were helping.

        <h3>Phase 3 - Wireframes and Iterations</h3>
          <p class="p2">Now it is finally time for the fun part of any project: to create!<br>
            I started with creating basic wireframes to create the flow that I had already decided 
            on in the earlier phase. Once I had them all down, I asked my mentor (Conor Souness) 
            for his opinions and we had a discussion about navigation options and colors that 
            helped me make decisions that I implemented.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">The wireframes were then put together into a first prototype that I tested 
              on five volontary users from earlier interviews. The feedback and information that 
              was gathered in these test were used to iterate the wireframes before I started working 
              on the details of the functions and the UI.

          so that all users could use it without having to think.I also pinned down the colors 
          that I wanted to use; Orange for energy and playfulness, and Purple for peace and independence.

        <h2>Version 3 - After User test</h2>
        <p class="p2">The user testings brought out some issues with the design that had to be 
          addressed, as well as some things that I saved for later implementations. Things that 
          I iterated on were the priority in the navigation, information about the difference in 
          accounts, some different names and symbols, and the ability to change the order of the 
          lists directly.</p>
          <p class="p2">I finished up the design with colors and a font that was easy to read but 
          fit the theme of the app.

        <h3>Results</h3>
          <p class="p2">This project resulted in a functioning MVP prototyp for an app that, 
            according to my inquiries and research, should be an assisting tool for people with 
            executive disabilities as well as lower the amount of time and effort any support 
            person for these people have to spend to help them. The app should reduce and/or 
            remove the amount of Energy that is used when disabled functions such as Motivation, 
            Planning, Concentration and Memory are needed, which should in turn reduce and/or 
            remove the additional stress and/or anxiety.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">The user flow of the app is intuitive and easy to use. The main function 
            is that the user can list the activities and/or chores that need to be done and then 
            recieve points once they are finished. Once enough points are collected the user level 
            up and recieves a reward that has been decided upon beforehand.<br>
            There are two different accounts depending on if you are the one needing the help, or 
            if you are the one helping. This is because during my research I found that the 
            majority of the people that I talked to confessed that they needed an authority figure 
            to approve of their job to get things done.

        <h3>Insights and the Future</h3>
          <p class="p2">This has been an inspiring project to work on, and since I too have executive 
            disabilities because of Neuropsychiatric disorders this app would be something that I myself 
            would be vary thankful to be able to use. Many of the people that I have talked to during 
            this project have sid that they feel the same, and they hope that the app will be available 
            some time in the future, which makes me feel happy and accomplished since that means that I 
            reached the goals that I was shooting for with this project.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">This has been an idea that I have had for many years, and it is an amazing 
              feeling to finally make it real, and I will continue working on it and hope that I can get 
              it developed some day.
