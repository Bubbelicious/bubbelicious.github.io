        <p class="p2"><b>A household game to make chores into fun</b><br><br>
            The graduation project that I created for the end of my education<br> 
            for UX design and Requirement engineering at Chas Academy.<br>
            The area that I chose to focus on was the difficulities that people with<br>
            executive disabilities, that are connected to diagnoses like Autism,<br>
            ADHD, etc, face every day when trying to get thing done.

        <h3>Phase 1 - Data and Analysis</h3>
          <p class="p2">After some preliminary research into the subject of Neuropsychiatric 
            diagnoses, I narrowed down the functions of the brain <br>that make up most of the
            executive abilities that people with these kind of issues have problem with.<br>
            Motivation, Concentration, Planning, Memory and Energy seemed to be the greatest
            villains of this story.<br>
            Using these functions I then gathered quantitative data by sending out a form on 
            social media to find out which of these <br>functions that gave them the most struggle.<br>
            I also gathered information about what kind of supportive products they have used 
            before and which of these were most <br>helpful, as well as if they have a support 
            person in their life.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">To follow up on the statistics from the form, I also encouraged people 
          to sign up for a unstruktured intervju to help me get a <br>better understanding of the 
          answers behind the numbers.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram I then analysed the data to be 
            able to create behaviour types that would help me keep <br>my work on the right track.</p></div>

              <h2>Results</h2>
                <p class="p2">I had to do two different analytics since my first form was 
                  only reached by people over the age of 26. I used the same form, <br>but had some 
                  help (by Lena Ogland) reaching a younger age group.<br>
                The results of the two analytics had no significant difference, so age would have no 
              impact on further work.</p>
                <p class="p2">I found that the majority of people with executive disabilities find 
                  that Motivation and Energy are what they have the <br>most issues with in their life, 
                  and depending on their diagnosis and age they may also experience some smaller issues <br>
                  with either Concentration or Memory as well.
                </p>
                <p class="p2">According to the statistics they have also used a series of different products 
                  to try and help, but they find lists the most <br>helpful so far even if it loses it's 
                  helpfulness as time passes. The statistics also said that not many had tried a rewarding 
                <br>system before, but all the ones that had tried it found it the most helpful thing they had 
              ever tried.</p></div>

            <h3>Phase 2 - Concept and Design</h3>
              <p class="p2">To get a grip of the concept that I wanted to focus on for this project I 
                sketched out the different stakeholders as well <br>as their preliminary needs. It's was 
                during this process that I realized that the app would need to have two different <br>
                accounts depending on if you needed help or if you were helping.

        <p>Snap! gives people with Neuropsychiatric disabilities, young and old, 
          the possibility to do their <br>chores without the additional stess <i>(function)</i>,

        <h3>Phase 3 - Wireframes and Iterations</h3>
          <p class="p2">Now it is finally time for the fun part of any project: to create!<br>
            I started with creating basic wireframes to create the flow that I had already decided 
            on in the earlier phase.<br>Once I had them all down, I asked my mentor (Conor Souness) 
            for his opinions and we had a discussion about <br>navigation options and colors that 
            helped me make decisions that I implemented.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">The wireframes were then put together into a first prototype that I tested 
              on five volontary users from <br>earlier interviews. The feedback and information that 
              was gathered in these test were used to iterate <br>the wireframes before I started working 
              on the details of the functions and the UI.

        <h2>Version 2 - After Discussion</h2>
        <p class="p2">After feedback and discussion I decided on making sure that there would 
          be several ways to go back to the <br>starting page (drag down, close button and logo), 
          so that all users could use it without having to think.<br>I also pinned down the colors 
          that I wanted to use; Orange for energy and playfulness, and Purple for <br>peace and independence.

        <h2>Version 3 - After User test</h2>
        <p class="p2">The user testings brought out some issues with the design that had to be 
          addressed, as well as some <br>things that I saved for later implementations. Things that 
          I iterated on were the priority in the navigation, <br>information about the difference in 
          accounts, some different names and symbols, and the ability to change <br>the order of the 
          lists directly.</p>
          <p class="p2">I finished up the design with colors and a font that was easy to read but 
          fit the theme of the app.
