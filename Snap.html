        <p class="p2"><b>A household game to make chores into fun</b><br><br>
            The graduation project that I created for the end of my education<br> 
            for UX design and Requirement engineering at Chas Academy.<br>
            The area that I chose to focus on was the difficulities that people with<br>
            executive disabilities, that are connected to diagnoses like Autism,<br>
            ADHD, etc, face every day when trying to get thing done.

        <h3>Phase 1 - Data and Analysis</h3>
          <p class="p2">After some preliminary research into the subject of Neuropsychiatric 
            diagnoses, I narrowed down the functions of the brain <br>that make up most of the
            executive abilities that people with these kind of issues have problem with.<br>
            Motivation, Concentration, Planning, Memory and Energy seemed to be the greatest
            villains of this story.<br>
            Using these functions I then gathered quantitative data by sending out a form on 
            social media to find out which of these <br>functions that gave them the most struggle.<br>
            I also gathered information about what kind of supportive products they have used 
            before and which of these were most <br>helpful, as well as if they have a support 
            person in their life.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">To follow up on the statistics from the form, I also encouraged people 
          to sign up for a unstruktured intervju to help me get a <br>better understanding of the 
          answers behind the numbers.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram I then analysed the data to be 
            able to create behaviour types that would help me keep <br>my work on the right track.</p></div>

              <h2>Results</h2>
                <p class="p2">I had to do two different analytics since my first form was 
                  only reached by people over the age of 26. I used the same form, <br>but had some 
                  help (by Lena Ogland) reaching a younger age group.<br>
                The results of the two analytics had no significant difference, so age would have no 
              impact on further work.</p>
                <p class="p2">I found that the majority of people with executive disabilities find 
                  that Motivation and Energy are what they have the <br>most issues with in their life, 
                  and depending on their diagnosis and age they may also experience some smaller issues <br>
                  with either Concentration or Memory as well.
                </p>
                <p class="p2">According to the statistics they have also used a series of different products 
                  to try and help, but they find lists the most <br>helpful so far even if it loses it's 
                  helpfulness as time passes. The statistics also said that not many had tried a rewarding 
                <br>system before, but all the ones that had tried it found it the most helpful thing they had 
              ever tried.</p></div>

            <h3>Phase 2 - Concept and Design</h3>
              <p class="p2">To get a grip of the concept that I wanted to focus on for this project I <br>
                sketched out the different stakeholders as well as their preliminary <br>needs. It's was 
                during this process that I realized that the app would <br>need to have two different 
                accounts depending on if you needed help or <br>if you were helping.
