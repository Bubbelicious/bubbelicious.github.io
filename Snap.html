        <p class="p2"><b>A household game to make chores into fun</b><br><br>
            The graduation project that I created for the end of my education<br> 
            for UX design and Requirement engineering at Chas Academy.<br>
            The area that I chose to focus on was the difficulities that people with<br>
            executive disabilities, that are connected to diagnoses like Autism,<br>
            ADHD, etc, face every day when trying to get thing done.

        <h3>Phase 1 - Data and Analysis</h3>
          <p class="p2">After some preliminary research into the subject of Neuropsychiatric 
            diagnoses, I narrowed down the functions of the brain that <br>make up most of the
            executive abilities that people with these kind of issues have problem with.<br>
            Motivation, Concentration, Planning, Memory and Energy seemed to be the greatest
            villains of this story.<br>
            Using these functions I then gathered quantitative data by sending out a form on 
            social media to find out which of these functions <br>that gave them the most struggle.<br>
            I also gathered information about what kind of supportive products they have used 
            before and which of these were most helpful, <br>as well as if they have a support 
            person in their life.
          </p>
          <p class="p2">To follow up on the statistics from the form, I also encouraged people 
          to sign up for a unstruktured intervju to help me get a <br>better understanding of the 
          answers behind the numbers.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram I then analysed the data to be 
            able to create behaviour types that would help me keep <br>my work on the right track.</p></div>
