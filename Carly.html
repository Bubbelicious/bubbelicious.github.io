                    Carly and the Reaperman is a VR game from Resolution Games that 
                    can be best played with two players, but is possible for one single 
                    player as well. It is a cooperative puzzle game where one player 
                    is Carly, running through the underworld, and the other is the 
                    Reaperman, who helps Carly create her path.
                  </p>
                <p class="p2">For this game I did a UX review of the start menu with my mentor (Conor Souness), and then 
                    created design suggestions for issues that we encountered.

                <h2>Review</h2> 
                <p class="p2">
                    The first thing we noted during the review was that almost no pages 
                    had a title to tell the player where in the menu they were, but also 
                    that the layout of some pages (like Continue Game and Join Game, for 
                    example) were not effective or easy to use.
                  </p>
                <p class="p2">Next we noted down the issues of accessibility that we discovered. The 
                    typography in the menu was a Serif type as well as very thin, which would 
                    have made readability an issue for many. We were also concerned about the 
                    contrast between text and button during the hover states, as well as the 
                    very sharp contrast between the black background and white menu assets 
                    which could cause a strain on the players' eyes in the longrun.

                <h2>Design Suggestions</h2> 
                <p class="p2">My mentor and I split up the different pages to work on. So while I 
                    started working on the Start Menu and the Play Menu, he tackled Join- and Host Game 
                    as well as Continue Game.

                <h2>Start Menu</h2> 
                <p class="p2">Since the designers of the game insisted on keeping the serif style 
                    in the menu, I made sure to include symbols in my design suggestion to make sure 
                    that it would be understandable and intuitive for every player. I also grouped 
                    the Play options together under one page to give a shorter Start Menu.
                  </p>
                <p class="p2">I made the Quit Game option red to break of the whiteness of the menu 
                    and to apply some color language so that the player understand the hierarchy of the 
                    options without having to think about it.

                <h2>Play Menu</h2> 
                <p class="p2">I didn't change a lot of the Play Menu in my design suggestion, but I did 
                    tighten up the layout to make sure that the player didn't need to turn their head 
                    when they went through it.
                  </p>
                <p class="p2">I added symbolics to this menu as well to create a more automatic response
                    for the player.

                <h2>Result</h2> 
                <p class="p2">If you are to compare the different stages, you can see that the designers 
                    of the game decided to use some of our suggestions, but ignore some as well. Despite 
                    us pointing out the contrast issues with the buttons' hover state, they decided to 
                    keep it as is. The same can be said about the layout of the Play menu that still is 
                    a little bit too wide for the player to be able to read it comfortably without turning 
                    their head.<br>
                    They did decide to use our suggestion of symbolics to make the menu more intuitive, as 
                    well as change the layout for the Continue Game page to make it consistent with the rest 
                    of the menus and easier to navigate.
                  </p>
                  <p class="p2">I think that the menu could be better still with at least one other iteration 
                      to solve some minor issues with positioning and states, and I found it somewhat 
                      disappointing that some of our opinions were not taken into account since they asked us 
                      for the review to begin with. <br>I hope that they will continue working on the menu further 
                      and maybe ask for a user test to make sure that the users are comfortable with the result.
