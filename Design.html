      <p>NoWa - No Waste</p>
      <p class="p1">An app born from a school project, the first big project
         we were given to teach us how to work together as we might have to on
          a workplace. We were a group of five which decided to concentrate on
          the theme of Sustainable Food Consumption, and once the project was 
          started, we begun with the User research. We interviewed people 
          outside of a local food market to learn about shopping behaviour, 
          put out a survey to learn about the food that people are throwing 
          out, and we started observing the people in our lives and how they 
          handled food. After analysing the data, creating personality types 
          and outlining the need of the users, we started sketching out rough
          designs on paper. Different kind of products were introduced during
          this phase, to try and find the most useful, such as an electronic 
          list for your fridge to keep track on expiration dates, but it was 
          decided that an app would cover more functions that we needed. So we 
          started writing out functions and planning the flow of the app, 
          splitting up the tasks to cover more ground. By this stage I was 
          nominated as design lead, and after the main design was decided upon, 
          I was in charge of producing almost all of the later iterations that 
          were needed between testings, including the logo we decided on. For 
          the first design, we all chose one function each to focus on, to first 
          make up some low-fid wireframes, and after feedback- and brainstorming 
          sessions, we moved up to low fid prototypes on Figma. After that we 
          did our first user testing, and made a high-fid prototype based on 
          the data we received, with me behind the necissery re-designs, and 
          after one last user testing and iteration with smaller changes, we 
          presented our work to the rest of the class and our teacher. Our 
          project received the highest grade on all deliveries.</p>
