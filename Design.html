      <p>NoWa - No Waste</p>
      <p class="p1">An app born from a school project. We were a group of five which 
        decided to concentrate on the theme of Sustainable Food 
        Consumption. We went through 4 deliveries in this project: 
        User research, Concept, Prototype and Iterations, all of which 
        received the highest grade. I was nominated and named the design 
        lead during the concept-delivery and held it through the rest of 
        the project, and made most of the designs that we decided to use 
        during the iterations. <i>(More information in progress)</i></p>

      <p>EU-Bike</p>
      <p class="p1">A school project in which we were tasked with 
        researching and testing the app to find out why it was so badly 
        reviewed. We worked alone, but had sessions of brainstorming in 
        groups occasionally. After analysing the data, we were to give 
        our own suggestions of changes in the app that we thought would 
        improve it, as well as presenting the ideas to our teachers while 
        explaining our reasoning, like you would to a client.

      <p>NärCon recrutement website</p>
      <p class="p1">As a volunteer at NärCon’s events, I am very 
        familiar with their recrutement website, as well as it’s flaws. 
        It is an old site at this point, and while it works it is far 
        from an effective or interactive design. I have taken upon myself 
        to redesign the site so that it is easier to navigate and 
        understand, as well as adapting it into a mobile friendly version. 
        Something that the current website doesn’t have. I work on it during 
        my free time, and have yet to present the idea to the people in 
        charge, but I will update as it progresses. <i>(More information in progress)</i></p>
