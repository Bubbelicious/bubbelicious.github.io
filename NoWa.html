      <h1>NoWa - No Waste</h1>
        <p class="p2">This school project was a group assignment where we <br>
            were told to focus on a subject within sustainable living. After <br>
            some discussion we decided to work with sustainable food consumption <br>
            with focus on food waste at home.</p></div>

        <h3>Phase 1 - User research</h3>
          <p class="p2">Quantitative data was gathered with a form that we 
            spread among our different social-groups. Data that was collected 
            were <br>concentrated on both the food waste as well as cooking and 
            shopping habits, to find out where in the process we should focus <br>
            our effort.</p>
          <p class="p2">Quality data was gathered with the use of both spontaneous 
              short interviews with customers outside a food market, as well as a <br>
              few slightly more in-depth interviews with people in our social group.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram we analysed 
          the data and reached some preliminary conclusions.</p></div>

    <p>Planning your food shopping around your meals should lessen the food waste, 
      and help the ones that <br>are unstructural to be proactive.<br><br>
      When you have less money, you plan your shopping better which makes for less food waste.</p>

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">We learned that when it comes to shopping, people tend to 
        shop for food 2-3 times/week and buy additions when needed, <br><b>or</b> they 
        shop only when they need something at random times during the week.</p>
      <p class="p2">Majority of people have a shopping list, but tend to stray from 
        it because of hankering and special prices, and they don’t usually <br>plan ahead 
        their meals and instead cook what they feel like at the time.</p>
      <p class="p2">What they want to have help with, according to our questions, 
        are structure and planning around what they have at home and <br>when it expires.</p></div>
        </div>
  <div class="project-page">
    <div><h2><i>The Problem</i></h2>
    <p>The average person throw out too much food because of bad planning.<br>
      We want to help them with the structure in their day to lessen their waste.

      <h3>Phase 2 - Concept</h3>
        <p class="p2">We wanted our product to contribute to an easier 
          way in planning the meals and shopping for every household.<br>
          We wanted it to have an overview of the products that are already 
          in the household and when they expire.
          </p>
        <p class="p2"><b>But</b></p>
        <p class="p2">We also need it to be easy to use and time effective, at least some 
        degree of auto generating, <br>as well as being able to give cooking inspiration to the user.</p></div>

          <h2>Process of product design</h2>
            <p class="p2">Earlier ideas included a device that was to be attached <br>
              onto the refrigerator, and have a detachable scanner you could use to <br>
              scan every food product you wanted to keep a closer eye on.</p>
            <p class="p2">After some discussion and brainstorming among the group, <br>
              we instead agreed to concentrate on designing an app in which all the <br>
              functions we wanted to incorporate could be added.</p></div>
