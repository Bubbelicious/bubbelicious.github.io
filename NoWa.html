      <h1>NoWa - No Waste</h1>
        <p class="p2">This school project was a group assignment where we <br>
            were told to focus on a subject within sustainable living. After <br>
            some discussion we decided to work with sustainable food consumption <br>
            with focus on food waste at home.</p></div>

        <h2>Phase 1 - User research</h2>
          <p class="p2">Quantitative data was gathered with a form that we 
            spread among our different social-groups. Data that was collected 
            were <br>concentrated on both the food waste as well as cooking and 
            shopping habits, to find out where in the process we should focus <br>
            our effort.</p>
          <p class="p2">Quality data was gathered with the use of both spontaneous 
              short interviews with customers outside a food market, as well as a <br>
              few slightly more in-depth interviews with people in our social group.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram we analysed 
          the data and reached some preliminary conclusions.</p></div>

    <p>Planning your food shopping around your meals should lessen the food waste, 
      and help the ones that are unstructural to be proactive.<br><br>
      When you have less money, you plan your shopping better which makes for less food waste.</p>

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">We learned that when it comes to shopping, people tend to 
        shop for food 2-3 times/week and buy additions when needed, <br><b>or</b> they 
        shop only when they need something at random times during the week.</p>
      <p class="p2">Majority of people have a shopping list, but tend to stray from 
        it because of hankering and special prices, and they donâ€™t usually plan ahead <br>
        their meals and instead cook what they feel like at the time.</p>
      <p class="p2">What they want to have help with, according to our questions, 
        are structure and planning around what they have at home and when it expires.</p></div>
