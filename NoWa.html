      <h1>NoWa - No Waste</h1>
        <p class="p2">This school project was a group assignment where we <br>
            were told to focus on a subject within sustainable living. After <br>
            some discussion we decided to work with sustainable food consumption <br>
            with focus on food waste at home.</p></div>

        <h3>Phase 1 - User research</h3>
          <p class="p2">Quantitative data was gathered with a form that we 
            spread among our different social-groups. Data that was collected 
            were <br>concentrated on both the food waste as well as cooking and 
            shopping habits, to find out where in the process we should focus <br>
            our effort.</p>
          <p class="p2">Quality data was gathered with the use of both spontaneous 
              short interviews with customers outside a food market, as well as a <br>
              few slightly more in-depth interviews with people in our social group.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram we analysed 
          the data and reached some preliminary conclusions.</p></div>

    <p>Planning your food shopping around your meals should lessen the food waste, 
      and help the ones that <br>are unstructural to be proactive.<br><br>
      When you have less money, you plan your shopping better which makes for less food waste.</p>

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">We learned that when it comes to shopping, people tend to 
        shop for food 2-3 times/week and buy additions when needed, <br><b>or</b> they 
        shop only when they need something at random times during the week.</p>
      <p class="p2">Majority of people have a shopping list, but tend to stray from 
        it because of hankering and special prices, and they don’t usually <br>plan ahead 
        their meals and instead cook what they feel like at the time.</p>
      <p class="p2">What they want to have help with, according to our questions, 
        are structure and planning around what they have at home and <br>when it expires.</p></div>
        </div>
  <div class="project-page">
    <div><h2><i>The Problem</i></h2>
    <p>The average person throw out too much food because of bad planning.<br>
      We want to help them with the structure in their day to lessen their waste.

      <h3>Phase 2 - Concept</h3>
        <p class="p2">We wanted our product to contribute to an easier 
          way in planning the meals and shopping for every household.<br>
          We wanted it to have an overview of the products that are already 
          in the household and when they expire.
          </p>
        <p class="p2"><b>But</b></p>
        <p class="p2">We also need it to be easy to use and time effective, at least some 
        degree of auto generating, <br>as well as being able to give cooking inspiration to the user.</p></div>

          <h2>Process of product design</h2>
            <p class="p2">Earlier ideas included a device that was to be attached <br>
              onto the refrigerator, and have a detachable scanner you could use to <br>
              scan every food product you wanted to keep a closer eye on.</p>
            <p class="p2">After some discussion and brainstorming among the group, <br>
              we instead agreed to concentrate on designing an app in which all the <br>
              functions we wanted to incorporate could be added.</p></div>

        <h2>Finished Concept</h2>
          <p class="p2">Bar codes contain product names, best-before dates and 
            expiration warnings (already available at Coop, for example, <br>
            where store staff receive expiration warnings on products, and can 
            lower the price of products a few days before) so it <br>should not be 
            so difficult to get this information in the app when scanning the code.</p>
          <p class="p2">The purpose of our app is to reduce food waste in the 
            home with the help of an app that keeps track of items in your <br>
            refrigerator, pantry when they are about to pass the best-before date, etc.</p>
          <p class="p2">It assists people with inspiration by searching for recipes 
            based on what is in the consumer's home and it uses food <br>that has 
            already been prepared to in a smart and effective way reduce the risk of 
            saved food having to be thrown away, <br>and help consumers with an 
            overview in their economy.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="project-page">
        <div class="pro-description">
        <p>The app helps private individuals to plan food consumption in the 
          household (function) <br>by providing functions that automate shopping 
          lists based on the menu, and provides an overview <br>of the food budget 
          and all food items in the home, including the food expiration date (mechanism).<br>
          The user gets a time-efficient tool that reduces personal food waste <br>
          and thus saves the user money and eases their conscience (value).</p>

          <p class="p2">What the customer wants to do is buy groceries, cook and 
            eat all the food. (Functional). <br>Furthermore, he wants a good 
            household economy (Emotional) and wants to be viewed as an <br>
            environmental friend, or at least not one who ignores the environment, 
            and that they want to <br>be perceived as someone who has control (Social).</p>
          <p class="p2">However, according to our primary type of behavior it is 
            difficult to meet these goals, mainly <br>because they are stressed and 
            unstructured. They often know what would need to be done, <br>but does not 
            get to the structure and planning.</p></div>

        <h2>Customer pains</h2>     
            <p class="p2">They are usually in the store without a shopping list 
            or plan for what to cook for <br>the week. Purchases go badly, they 
            buy twice as much of something that <br>is already at home or forgets to buy 
            certain products because they do not know <br>what is already at home and what 
            is to be cooked for the week. Food has time to <br>get old and is forgotten at 
            the bottom of the fridge. They throw away food and <br>have a bad conscience 
            about it as it costs money and they know that it is bad <br>for the environment.</p>
          <p class="p2"><b>Pain reliever:</b> As our product NOWA No Waste, is a mobile app, 
            the customer always <br>have all the functions at hand both at home and in the 
            store. The app syncs the <br>shopping list to what you have at home, it reminds 
            you of the expiration date for <br>what will soon be out and comes automatically 
            with recipe and menu suggestions based <br>on these items. You can also get an 
            overview of your food budget and know what <br>deposits you have made and what 
            you have bought.</p></div>

         <h2>Customer Gains</h2>
          <p class="p2">What the customer would like is to save time and money, have a 
            structure to be able<br> to reduce their food waste and ease their conscience. 
            They also need inspiration for <br>everyday cooking, both in the form of recipes and menus.</p>
          <p class="p2"><b>Gain creator:</b> The functions in the product offer an overview 
            and help with planning. <br>Most things are created automatically (menu, shopping lists, 
            recipes) so they do not <br>get one more thing on the "to-do list" that takes time. 
            Everything is connected to <br>the store card you have at Coop, for example. If the 
            person has used other apps <br>and websites that do not communicate with each other but 
            are used one by one, or maybe <br>lists on paper, then this will now be an app 
            where you have gathered <br>everything. It is an efficient and time-saving tool that 
            brings together all the <br>functions that are about food shopping and cooking 
            in one place.</p>
