        <p class="p2">This school project was a group assignment where we 
            were told to focus on a subject within sustainable living. After 
            some discussion we decided to work with sustainable food consumption 
            with focus on food waste at home.<br>

        <h3>Phase 1 - User research</h3>
          <p class="p2">Quantitative data was gathered with a form that we 
            spread among our different social-groups. Data that was collected 
            were concentrated on both the food waste as well as cooking and 
            shopping habits, to find out where in the process we should focus 
            our effort.</p>
          <p class="p2">Quality data was gathered with the use of both spontaneous 
              short interviews with customers outside a food market, as well as a 
              few slightly more in-depth interviews with people in our social group.</p>
          <p class="p2">With the help of an affinity diagram we analysed 
          the data and reached some preliminary conclusions.</p></div>

    <p>Planning your food shopping around your meals should lessen the food waste, 
      and help the ones that are unstructural to be proactive.<br><br>
      When you have less money, you plan your shopping better which makes for less food waste.</p>

    <h2>Result of research</h2>
      <p class="p2">We learned that when it comes to shopping, people tend to 
        shop for food 2-3 times/week and buy additions when needed, <b>or</b> they 
        shop only when they need something at random times during the week.</p>
      <p class="p2">Majority of people have a shopping list, but tend to stray from 
        it because of hankering and special prices, and they don’t usually plan ahead 
        their meals and instead cook what they feel like at the time.</p>
      <p class="p2">What they want to have help with, according to our questions, 
        are structure and planning around what they have at home and when it expires.</p></div>
        </div>
  <div class="project-page">
    <div style="margin:auto;"><h2><i>The Problem</i></h2>
    <p>The average person throw out too much food because of bad planning.<br>
      We want to help them with the structure in their day to lessen their waste.

      <h3>Phase 2 - Concept</h3>
        <p class="p2">We wanted our product to contribute to an easier 
          way in planning the meals and shopping for every household.
          We wanted it to have an overview of the products that are already 
          in the household and when they expire.
          </p>
        <p class="p2"><b>But</b></p>
        <p class="p2">We also need it to be easy to use and time effective, at least some 
        degree of auto generating, as well as being able to give cooking inspiration to the user.</p></div>

          <h2>Process of product design</h2>
            <p class="p2">Earlier ideas included a device that was to be attached 
              onto the refrigerator, and have a detachable scanner you could use to 
              scan every food product you wanted to keep a closer eye on.</p>
            <p class="p2">After some discussion and brainstorming among the group, 
              we instead agreed to concentrate on designing an app in which all the 
              functions we wanted to incorporate could be added.</p></div>

        <h2>Finished Concept</h2>
          <p class="p2">Bar codes contain product names, best-before dates and 
            expiration warnings (already available at Coop, for example, 
            where store staff receive expiration warnings on products, and can 
            lower the price of products a few days before) so it should not be 
            so difficult to get this information in the app when scanning the code.</p>
          <p class="p2">The purpose of our app is to reduce food waste in the 
            home with the help of an app that keeps track of items in your 
            refrigerator, pantry when they are about to pass the best-before date, etc.</p>
          <p class="p2">It assists people with inspiration by searching for recipes 
            based on what is in the consumer's home and it uses food that has 
            already been prepared to in a smart and effective way reduce the risk of 
            saved food having to be thrown away, and help consumers with an 
            overview in their economy.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="project-page">
        <div class="pro-description">
        <p>The app helps private individuals to plan food consumption in the 
          household (function) by providing functions that automate shopping 
          lists based on the menu, and provides an overview of the food budget 
          and all food items in the home, including the food expiration date (mechanism).
          The user gets a time-efficient tool that reduces personal food waste 
          and thus saves the user money and eases their conscience (value).</p>

          <p class="p2">What the customer wants to do is buy groceries, cook and 
            eat all the food. (Functional). Furthermore, he wants a good 
            household economy (Emotional) and wants to be viewed as an 
            environmental friend, or at least not one who ignores the environment, 
            and that they want to be perceived as someone who has control (Social).</p>
          <p class="p2">However, according to our primary type of behavior it is 
            difficult to meet these goals, mainly because they are stressed and 
            unstructured. They often know what would need to be done, but does not 
            get to the structure and planning.</p></div>

        <h2>Customer pains</h2>     
            <p class="p2">They are usually in the store without a shopping list 
            or plan for what to cook for the week. Purchases go badly, they 
            buy twice as much of something that is already at home or forgets to buy 
            certain products because they do not know what is already at home and what 
            is to be cooked for the week. Food has time to get old and is forgotten at 
            the bottom of the fridge. They throw away food and have a bad conscience 
            about it as it costs money and they know that it is bad for the environment.</p>
          <p class="p2"><b>Pain reliever:</b> As our product NOWA No Waste, is a mobile app, 
            the customer always have all the functions at hand both at home and in the 
            store. The app syncs the shopping list to what you have at home, it reminds 
            you of the expiration date for what will soon be out and comes automatically 
            with recipe and menu suggestions based on these items. You can also get an 
            overview of your food budget and know what deposits you have made and what 
            you have bought.</p></div>

         <h2>Customer Gains</h2>
          <p class="p2">What the customer would like is to save time and money, have a 
            structure to be able to reduce their food waste and ease their conscience. 
            They also need inspiration for everyday cooking, both in the form of recipes and menus.</p>
          <p class="p2"><b>Gain creator:</b> The functions in the product offer an overview 
            and help with planning. Most things are created automatically (menu, shopping lists, 
            recipes) so they do not get one more thing on the "to-do list" that takes time. 
            Everything is connected to the store card you have at Coop, for example. If the 
            person has used other apps and websites that do not communicate with each other but 
            are used one by one, or maybe lists on paper, then this will now be an app 
            where you have gathered everything. It is an efficient and time-saving tool that 
            brings together all the functions that are about food shopping and cooking 
            in one place.</p>

            <h3>Phase 3 - Design Prototype</h3>
              <p class="p2">Using Figma, everyone in the group chose one, or in some cases two, functions 
              to focus on. During this process of work, we had several workshops together to 
              make sure that all of our designs were cohesive and worked well with each other. 
              I, personally, were responsible for the functions of Search and Recipes, as well as
              designing the logo. Once we found the parts satisfactory, it was my responsibility 
              to connect them all into one functioning prototype.

              <p class="p2">This was the design we settled on for the loggin and home page.<br>
              We made sure to use as much familiar shapes and icons as possible, to make it available 
            for every user, even of they have less experience with apps.<br>
            The colors we chose (green, grey, orange/yellow), were chosen for the reognizing factor

                The first thing you enter in the profile is information about your household: 
                How many are you? Are there special diets or allergies to consider? 
                How much time do you want to spend most on cooking your food? This way, the app 
                can sort out the recipes that are not <br>relevant to you when searching for recipes.<br>
                You register your coop / ica card (etc), with bankID of course.<br>

        fridge, freezer and pantry, the goods that have received an expiration warning 
        and needs to be used soon, as well as your profile settings.</p>
        <p class="p2">In the listing for the week, you can click on the dish and get the recipe.<br>
          While there you can also add / remove today's dish if you want, and when you add 
          recipes to the menu that contain ingredients you do not have at home, you are warned, 
          and you have a function at the bottom of the mealplan that leads directly to creating 
          a shopping list based on what you need for the week's dishes.</p>

        product it is and the expiration date. That information is entered immediately when the 
        product is scanned and then you can decide which category you want to put it in.

        you can change the amount per month.</p>
        <p class="p2">If you press the History button, you can see expenses and deposits. Maybe you have 
        a direct debit, where the food money is deducted from the salary account and deposited 
        in the food account every month. Or you make a manual deposit at the checkout in the 
        grocery store. It is all controlled by your selective grocery card which is linked to 
        the account.</p>

        time restrains, we did not have time to do any more iterations then one, but got plenty of positive feedback
        from the changes we made to the design. From our user tests we got some very valuable observations, as well

        We have learned to follow the users' needs and the importance of testing and iterating, as well as
        that users discover things that they have not thought of themselves.<br>
        One of the more surprising things we learned was that we have produced something new and useful.<br>
        According to the majority of our feedback, the app is needed since many have problems with food waste, 
        and that there is an active interest in our product, should we decide to have it developed 
        ("I would download the app if it existed")
